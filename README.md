# Guardian_Knight
First Game I ever made. Made using Scratch 2. 

Guardian knight 1.3.1. exe is the file to play it. If you want to use it in a scratch 2 editor then use the 1.3.1.SB2 is the final version. Took almost a full year to make and being completely biased I think it is probably one of the most complete games ever made in the scratch code.

Its doubtful anyone will ever beat it other than me as it is pretty dang hard, but the boss fights are pretty good. I has 2 different endings and about 15 diffrent levels and 3 boss fights.

If anyone ever plays and beats this let me know. Ill slap you a virtual high five.
