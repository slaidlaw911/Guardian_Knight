# Guardian_Knight
First Game I ever made. Made using Scratch 2. I actually had to finish the last few bug fixes offline as the move to Scratch 3 destroyed the game almost completely and I just didnt have it in me to remake the entire game all over again. 

Its doubtful anyone will ever beat it other than me as it is pretty dang hard, but the boss fights are pretty good. I has 2 different endings and about 15 diffrent levels and 3 boss fights.


Guardian knight 1.3.1. exe is the file to play it. it is a flash projection file and will give warnings about trusting the file. Trust it if you want, at this phase I couldnt write a virus if I tried.

If you want to use it in a scratch 2 editor then use the 1.3.1.SB2 is the final version. Took almost a full year to make and being completely biased I think it is probably one of the most complete games ever made in the scratch code.


If anyone ever plays and beats this let me know. Ill slap you a virtual high five.
